Please contact us if you see any content which infringes upon these rules.
    <h2>Damage to your computer or other device</h2>
    Franzar takes reasonable efforts to ensure that this website is absent of viruses and other malicious content. However we make no guarantee that your use of this website will not cause damage to your computer or other devices. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the right equipment (such as antivirus software) to safely use this website and all applications related to Franzar. You are solely responsible for blocking anything that may cause damage or harm your computer or other devices. Franzar will not be liable to any person(s) for any loss or damage which results from viruses or other malicious content which they access from this website except where required by applicable United States law.
    <h2>Disputes</h2>
    Any dispute or claim relating to your use, purchase, or consumption of any Franzar product or service which are sold, provided, created, modified, or distributed by the Franzar Corporation or through Franzar.com will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court. The only exception is that you may file claims in small claims court if those claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration laws apply to this agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and any court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can choose to award the same damages and relief as a court on an individual basis, and must follow these terms as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our mailing address 2292 Toad Hollow Trail, Apex North Carolina 27502-9507 United States of America. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 USD unless the arbitrator determines the claims are in vain. The Franzar Corporation will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are in vain. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted via telephone, written submissions, or in-person at a mutually agreed location. Both you and the Franzar Corporation agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, both you and the Franzar Corporation waive any right to a jury trial. Both you and the Franzar Corporation agree that you or we may file a suit in court reguarding infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. The right to file a suit against the Franzar Corporation does not extend your right to intellectual property as outlined in this agreement.
    <h2>Applicable Law</h2>
    By using any Franzar product and/or service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal laws, and the laws of the state of North Carolina, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and Conditions and any dispute which may arise between you and the Franzar Corporation, its affiliates, or thrid parties.
